<p>　10の島からなる諸島がある。それぞれの島は2つの島に隣接しており、全体で円になっている。各島は面積が異なり、それに比例して人口も異なる。面積と人口は1つめの島から順に2倍、3倍、…10倍になっている(つまり、1つめの島の大きさと人口が1だとすれば、10個目の島はそれぞれ10である)。<br />
　さて、この諸島の王様は1週間ごとに島々を訪れるが、その際には隣接している島にしか移動できない。王様は各島を人口比率に応じて訪れたいが、訪問計画を長期的に策定するのは面倒である。そこで、彼の側近は以下の方法で島を訪れることを提案した。この方法に従えば、各島に訪れる頻度が人口比率に一致する。ここではこの方法を<em>Metropolis algorithm</em>と呼ぶ。</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>毎週王様はその島にとどまるか、隣接するいずれかの島に移動するかをコインを投げて決める。<br />
</li>
<li>もしコインが表なら、王様は時計回りに隣の島に移動することを考える。一方コインが裏なら、反時計回りに移動することを考える。ここで、提案された島を<em>proposal island</em>とする。<br />
</li>
<li>王様は<em>porposal island</em>の大きさだけ(7つめの島にいるなら7個)貝殻を集める。また、現在いる島の大きさだけ同様に石を集める。<br />
</li>
<li>もし貝殻の数が石よりも多ければ、王様は<em>proposal island</em>へ移動する。一方で石の数の方が多い場合、王様は集めた石から貝殻と同数の石を捨てる(例えば石が6つ、貝殻が4つなら、手元には<span class="math inline">\(6-4=2\)</span>個の石が残る)。その後、残された石と貝殻をカバンに入れ、王様はランダムにそのうちの一つを引く。もしそれが貝殻ならば<em>proposal island</em>に移動し、石ならば今いる島に留まる。<br />
<br /></li>
</ol>
<p>この方法は一見奇妙だが、長期間繰り返していくと非常にうまくいく。以下でシミュレーションしてみよう。</p>

<p>　国王が用いたアルゴリズムは<em>Metropolis algorythm</em>の特殊例であり、このアルゴリズムは<strong>マルコフ連鎖モンテカルロ法</strong>の一つである。この方法は未知の分布からサンプルを収集するために用いられる。本章では、<em>Metropolis algorythm</em>の改良版である<em>Gibbs sampling</em>について概説する。</p>
<div id="gibbs-sampling" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="9.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.2.1</span> Gibbs sampling<a href="marcov-chain-monte-carlo.html#gibbs-sampling" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>　上記のアルゴリズムでは次の島への移動の提案はランダムに(コインによって)行われていたが、より効率よくサンプリングをするためには事後確率に応じて提案が行われる必要がある。そのようなアルゴリズムの一つが<em>Gibbs sampling</em>である。<br />
<em>Gibbs sampling</em>は<em>conjugate pairs</em>と呼ばれる特定の事前分布と尤度の組み合わせを用いる方法で、JAGSやBUGSで実装されている。</p>
</div>
<div id="high-dimentional-problem" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="9.2.2">

<p>　<em>Gibbs sampling</em>は<em>conjugate pairs</em>が複雑なモデルになると使えなかったり、非効率になったりするという問題点がある。例えば、パラメータ数が多いモデルではパラメータ間に相関がみられることが多く、そのような場合に上手くサンプリングが行えない。<br />
また、<em>concentration of measure</em>という問題によって、パラメータ数が多くなるほどサンプリングは困難になる。まず、あるパラメータの組み合わせの最頻値からの距離を考える。このとき、パラメータ数が多くなるほど、最頻値から離れた距離にあるパラメータの組み合わせが最も多くなってしまう。そのため、パラメータ数が多いほど、最頻値からサンプリングされる確率が低くなってしまう。<br />
　以下がシミュレーションである。パラメータ数が増えるにつれて、最頻値(この場合は全てのパラメータが0のとき)から離れたところにあるものが一番多くなることが分かる。</p>

<p><em>Hamiltonian Monte Carlo(HMC)</em>法は<em>Gibbs sampling</em>などよりも効率的にサンプリングができるアルゴリズムで、パラメータ数が多くなっても他のアルゴリズムに比べてうまく推定ができる。</p>
<div id="another-probable" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="9.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.3.1</span> Another probable<a href="marcov-chain-monte-carlo.html#another-probable" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>　ここで、またある国を考える。この国の領土は南北に伸びる狭い谷に広がっており、国民は標高と反比例して分布している(高い場所ほど人口が少ない)。さて、この国の国王も国民の人口比率に応じて国中を訪れなければいけないとする。彼の側近の<em>Hamilton</em>は以下のアルゴリズムに従えばうまくいくことを提案した。</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>国王の車はまずランダムな方向にランダムな運動量で動き出す。車は坂道を上がると速度を落とし、やがて運動量の減少とともに坂道を下ってまた加速していく。</li>
<li>一定時間後に車を止めて国民にあいさつをする。<br />
</li>
<li>(1)と(2)を繰り返す。</li>
</ol>
<p>　この規則に従うとき、長期的に見れば車がある場所を訪れる頻度は標高に反比例する。この方法はサンプル内の自己相関が低くなるので、分布の幅広い範囲を探索することができる。この方法は諸島では採用できない。なぜならこの方法は国土が連続的であること(=パラメータが連続変数であること)を前提としているからである。<br />
　2つのパラメータで簡単なシミュレーションを行う。ここでは以下の統計モデルを用いる。<br />
<br /></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
x_{i} &amp;\sim Normal(\mu_{x},1) \\  
y_{i} &amp;\sim Normal(\mu_{y},1) \\
\mu_{x} &amp;\sim Normal(0,0.5)  \\
\mu_{y} &amp;\sim Normal(0,0.5)  
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>　HMCでは、2つの関数と2つの設定によって動く。まず一つ目は対数事後確率であり、以下のようになる(ベイズの定理の分子)。これは、上記の例でいうと標高を表す。<br />
<br /></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
U = \sum_{i} logp(y_{i}|\mu_{y},1) + \sum_{i} logp(x_{i}|\mu_{x},1) + logp(\mu_{y}|0.0.5) + logp(\mu_{x}|0.0.5)
\]</span><br />
<br /></p>
<p>続いて、もう一つ必要な関数は傾きであり、上記の式を<span class="math inline">\(\mu_{x}\)</span>と<span class="math inline">\(\mu_{y}\)</span>について偏微分したものに相当する。<span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial logN(y|a,b)}{\partial a} = \frac{y-a}{b^2}\)</span>なので、<br />
<br /></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}  
  \frac{\partial U}{\partial \mu_{x}} &amp;= \frac{\partial logN(x|\mu_{x},1)}{\partial \mu_{x}} + \frac{\partial logN(\mu_{x}|0,0.5)}{\partial \mu_{x}} = \sum_{i} \frac {x_{i} - \mu_{x}}{1^2} + \frac {0-\mu_{x}}{0.5^2} \\  
  \frac{\partial U}{\partial \mu_{y}} &amp;= \frac{\partial logN(y|\mu_{y},1)}{\partial \mu_{y}} + \frac{\partial logN(\mu_{y}|0,0.5)}{\partial \mu_{y}} = \sum_{i} \frac {y_{i} - \mu_{y}}{1^2} + \frac {0-\mu_{y}}{0.5^2}
\end{aligned}
\]</span>
<br /></p>
<p>　必要な2つの設定は、<strong>step size</strong>と<strong>leapfrog steps</strong>の数(何ステップに1回サンプリングするか)である。効率的にサンプリングするためには、これらを適切に設定することが必要であるが、通常はソフトウェアが設定してくれる。stanでは、warmup期間中にこのチューニングが行われる。また、NUTSというアルゴリズムによって、運動ベクトルが大きく変わった時にサンプリングを行うことで、同じ場所からばかりサンプリングが行われることを防いでいる。</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.3.2</span> Limitations<a href="marcov-chain-monte-carlo.html#limitations" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>　上述のようにHMCは離散的なパラメータを扱えない。ただし、うまくコードを変えればそれらも扱うことができる。また、事後分布がうまくサンプルできないこともしばしばある(devergent transitionなど)。</p>

<p>トレースプロットの診断では、以下の3つの基準を満たしているかを確認する。</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>stationarity<br />
chainがある一定の範囲から安定して得られているか。別の言い方をすると、サンプルの平均値が最初から最後まで安定しているか。<br />
</li>
<li>good mixing<br />
chainが全ての範囲から素早く探索できているか。<br />
</li>
<li>convergence<br />
それぞれのchainが同じ範囲に収まっているか。<br />
<br /></li>
</ol>
<p>もうひとつ収束を確認する方法として<strong>trace rank plot</strong>、もしくは<strong>trank plot</strong>をみるというものがある。これは、サンプルを小さい方から順に1, 2, 3,…,Nというように順位づけ、chainごとにヒストグラムを描くというもの。もしうまく収束できていれば、各ヒストグラムは似たような形になり、重複するはず。</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>重要なのはどのくらい有効サンプル数(自己相関していないマルコフ連鎖の長さ)である。有効サンプルサイズはサンプルに負の自己相関がある場合には、chainの長さよりも大きくなることがありうる。なお、bulk-ESSは事後分布の中心でどの程度有効サンプルが得られているかを評価している一方で、tail-ESSはより広い区間についてのものであるので、区間推定を行う場合にはtail-ESSに着目する。<br />
</li>
<li>何を知りたいかによって必要なサンプルサイズは異なる。もし事後分布の平均を知りたいだけであればそこまで多くのサンプルを必要としないが、より広い範囲(例えば、99%信用区間など)について調べたければ、より多くのサンプルを必要とする。一般的に、平均の推定値を知りたいだけならば、有効サンプルサイズは200程度でよい。また、事後分布が正規分布に近似できれば、分布の分散を推定すればうまく区間推定ができるが、偏りのある分布では区間推定のために多くのサンプルを必要とする。</li>

<li>デバッグをする場合には、まず1つを回してうまくいくか確認する。<br />
</li>
<li>その後、終息の診断をするときには1つ以上のchainが必要。その場合、3~4個で十分。<br />
</li>
<li>最後に(上手く収束することが分かった後に)推定をする際には1つでも構わない。2つ以上でもよいが、全てのchainでwarmupすることになるので、効率は悪くなる。</li>

<p>Re-estimate the terrain ruggedness model from the chapter, but now using a uniform prior and an exponential prior for the standard deviation, sigma. The uniform prior should be dunif(0,10) and the exponential should be dexp(1). Do the different priors have any detectable influence on the posterior distribution?</p>
