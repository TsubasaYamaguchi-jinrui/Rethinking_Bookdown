               Stan builds your knowledge of and confidence in making
               inferences from data. Reflecting the need for scripting in
               today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform
               step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This
               unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough
               of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in
               your own modeling work. The text presents causal inference and
               generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian
               perspective that builds on information theory and maximum
               entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression
               to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement
               error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and
               phylogenetic confounding. The second edition emphasizes the
               directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference,
               integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also
               contains new material on the design of prior distributions,
               splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations
               models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental
               variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely
               new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling,
               showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into
               statistical analyses. Features Integrates working code into the
               main text Illustrates concepts through worked data analysis

  author    = "Koster, Jeremy M and Leckie, George",
  abstract  = "Previous research on food sharing in small-scale societies

               evolutionary anthropologists have devoted relatively little
               attention to the broader relational context of inter-household
               transfers of food. The present research observes transfers of
               meat over a yearlong period among 25 households of indigenous
               Mayangna and Miskito horticulturalists in Nicaragua. To analyze
               these data, we extend the multilevel formulation of the social
               relations model to count data, namely the number of portions of
               meat exchanged between households. Along with other covariates,
               we examine the effect of an ``association index,'' which
               reflects the amount of time that households interact with one
               another. The association index exhibits a positive effect on
               sharing, and our overall results indicate that food sharing
               networks largely correspond to kin-based networks of social
               interaction, suggesting that food sharing is embedded in broader
               social relationships between households. We discuss possible
               extensions of our methodological approach, as appropriate for
               research on food sharing and social network analysis more

  abstract  = "Explanations for primate brain expansion and the evolution of
               human cognition and culture remain contentious despite extensive
               research. While multiple comparative analyses have investigated
               variation in brain size across primate species, very few have
               addressed why primates vary in how much they use social
               learning. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that the enhanced
               reliance on socially transmitted behavior observed in some
               primates has coevolved with enlarged brains, complex sociality,
               and extended lifespans. Using recently developed phylogenetic
               comparative methods we show that, across primate species, a
               measure of social learning proclivity increases with absolute
               and relative brain volume, longevity (specifically reproductive
               lifespan), and social group size, correcting for research
               effort. We also confirm relationships of absolute and relative
               brain volume with longevity (both juvenile period and
               reproductive lifespan) and social group size, although longevity
               is generally the stronger predictor. Relationships between
               social learning, brain volume, and longevity remain when
               controlling for maternal investment and are therefore not simply
               explained as a by-product of the generally slower life history
               expected for larger brained species. Our findings suggest that
               both brain expansion and high reliance on culturally transmitted
               behavior coevolved with sociality and extended lifespan in
               primates. This coevolution is consistent with the hypothesis
               that the evolution of large brains, sociality, and long
               lifespans has promoted reliance on culture, with reliance on
               culture in turn driving further increases in brain volume,
               cognitive abilities, and lifespans in some primate lineages.",

               of this process predict that large, well-connected populations
               will have more diverse and complex tool kits than small,
               isolated populations. While several examples of the loss of
               technology in small populations are consistent with this
               prediction, it found no support in two systematic quantitative
               tests. Both studies were based on data from continental
               populations in which contact rates were not available, and
               therefore these studies do not provide a test of the models.

  abstract  = "Long-term male--female bonds and bi-parental investment in
               offspring are hallmarks of human society. A key question is how
               these traits evolved from the polygynandrously mating multimale
               multifemale society that likely characterized the Pan-Homo
               ancestor. In all three species of savanna baboons, lactating
               females form strong ties (sometimes called ``friendships'') with
               one or more adult males. For yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus)
               and chacma baboons (Papio ursinus), several lines of evidence
               suggest that these relationships are a form of male parenting
               effort. In olive baboons (Papio anubis), females are thought to
               preferentially mate with their ``friends'', and male-female
               bonds may thus function as a form of mating effort. Here, we
               draw on behavioral and genetic data to evaluate the factors that
               shape male-female relationships in a well-studied population of
               olive baboons. We find support for the parenting effort
               hypothesis in that sires have stronger bonds with their infants'
               mothers than do other males. These bonds sometimes persist past
               weaning age and, in many cases, the sire of the previous infant
               is still a close partner of the female when she nurses her
               subsequent offspring. We find that males who have the strongest
               bonds with females that have resumed cycling, but are not
               currently sexually receptive, are more likely to sire the
               female's next offspring but the estimate is associated with
               large statistical uncertainty. We also find that in over one
               third of the cases, a female's successive infants were sired by
               the same male. Thus, in olive baboons, the development of stable
               breeding bonds and paternal investment seem to be grounded in
               the formation of close ties between males and anestrous females.
               However, other factors such as male dominance rank also
               influence paternity success and may preclude stability of these
               bonds to the extent found in human societies.",

  abstract  = "Male mating tactics vary extensively in many primates. Some
               variation occurs because adolescent males often are sexually
               active but cannot invest heavily in mating effort because of
               their limited ability to compete directly with adults and
               because they are still investing in growth; consequently, most
               of their mating attempts may be surreptitious and/or with
               females whose fecundity is low. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)
               have a complex mating system: most copulations occur between
               estrous females with full sexual swelling and multiple males in
               group settings where the potential for sperm competition is
               high, but males sometimes mate-guard females, and sometimes
               male-female pairs mate exclusively with each other while
               avoiding other males during ``consortships.'' Among other
               factors, dominance ranks, coalition formation, and variation in
               male-female association influence male mating and reproductive
               success. Mating effort increases from adolescence into prime
               adulthood. At Gombe and Mahale, adolescent males copulated more
               with nulliparous than with parous females, and mostly when
               females were unlikely to be ovulating, partly because of low
               adult male interest in nulliparous females and partly because of
               aggression from or avoidance of adult males. Adolescents thus
               had low probabilities of siring infants. However, adolescents
               are known to have gained some paternity at Gombe and in other
               populations, and their mating behavior deserves more study. I
               present data on mating by adolescent males in an unusually large
               chimpanzee community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda.
               Adolescents at Ngogo also copulated more with nulliparous than
               parous females and mostly copulated outside of periovulatory
               periods. Also, they directed less aggression at estrous females
               than did adult males. However, they gained lower shares of
               copulations than reported for Gombe and Mahale, regardless of
               female parity, and received more aggression from adult males.
               These differences might partly reflect the influence of
               variation in the number of males per community on male mating
               tactics.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are notable for
              exhibiting high levels of male-to-female aggression. Much of this
              aggression from adult males serves sexually coercive functions.
              Despite being smaller and lower-ranking than adult males,
              adolescent males also engage in regular aggression against adult
              females. Here, we test whether the primary function of this
              aggression is sexual coercion, as in adult males, or,
              alternatively, whether adolescent males use aggression to
              establish social dominance over females. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
              We analyzed 1771 copulations and 1812 instances of male-initiated
              aggression between adolescent males (aged nine through 14 years)
              and adult females across 21 years of observation of the Kanyawara
              chimpanzee community in Kibale National Park, Uganda. RESULTS:
              Our test of the sexual coercion hypothesis revealed that
              adolescent males did not selectively target cycling females for
              aggression, nor did aggression against cycling females predict
              rates of copulation with those females. Our test of the social
              dominance hypothesis showed that males succeeded in dominating
              all adult females before, or soon after, dominating their first
              adult male. Additionally, we found that adolescent males
              dominated females approximately in the order of the females' own
              ranks, from the bottom to the top of the female hierarchy.
              DISCUSSION: Our data illustrate that the establishment of social
              dominance was more important than sexual coercion in explaining
              patterns of adolescent male aggression toward females. In
              comparison, evidence for sexual coercion was clear and compelling
              in adult males. These findings highlight that the primary
              function of male-to-female aggression differs between adolescent
              and adult males.",
